Millions of Muslims are spied on every year illegally by terrorist organizations such as the NSA and Mossad, this repo is to bring awareness of anonymity guides and privacy guides to Muslims

I highly recommend you also read [the anonymousplanet guide to anonymity](https://anonymousplanet.org/guide.html), if you have ADHD and are unable to read it then simply skim over the necessary resources.

The jist of this project is; if you use WhatsApp don't use it and use [Signal](https://signal.org/download/) instead

If you are an advanced user who speaks to other advanced users, I highly recommend using an [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/) client such as [Gajim](https://gajim.org/) or [Dino](https://dino.im/) in combination [i2p](https://geti2p.net/en/)
